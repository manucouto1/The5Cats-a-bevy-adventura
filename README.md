## üìñ About the Project

This repository contains an **in-progress 2D platformer** developed with the [Bevy 0.16](https://bevyengine.org) game engine.  
The project is not finished yet ‚Äî it started as a **personal challenge to learn Rust** while building something fun and practical.  

It is an adaptation of a **Pygame project** I developed together with classmates for a Master's degree assignment in Computer Engineering.  

This version is being rewritten in **Rust** (a language I'm still learning), using **Bevy**, a young game engine with few tutorials and a constantly evolving API. This makes the project both challenging and exciting.
